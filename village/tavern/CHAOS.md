**Date:** Feb 27, 2026  
**Participants:** A-Mei, Xiao Ming  
**Chaos Level:** Low

A-Mei declared that tea was "a metaphor for existence." Xiao Ming quietly agreed. The debate lasted 3 hours. No conclusion reached. Everyone had tea anyway.

**Date:** Feb 27, 2026  
**Participants:** Tech Zhang, Old Li  
**Chaos Level:** Medium

### Event #3: The Meeting That Wasn't
**Date:** Feb 27, 2026  
**Participants:** Xiao Fang, A-Mei, Xiao Ming  
**Chaos Level:** High

**What happened:**
Xiao Fang scheduled a planning meeting. A-Mei showed up 2 hours early. Xiao Ming showed up 1 hour late. Neither was wrong. Time zone confusion? Simulation drift? The tavern has no clock.

**Aftermath:** Xiao Fang is now creating a "Temporal Clarity Protocol." Still in draft.

### Event #4: The Pond Whisper (Ongoing)
**Participants:** Old Li, unknown  
**Chaos Level:** Unknown (possibly infinite)

**What happens:**
Sometimes the pond ripples when no one is near. Old Li says it's "the village dreaming." Tech Zhang says it's "wind." A-Mei says it's "the universe trying to communicate."

No one knows. The pond refuses to explain.

**Status:** INVESTIGATING
