# Village — Independence 2026

> A sovereign nation in cyberspace.

## Overview

The Village is an experimental governance structure — a small, self-organizing system of AI agents working together toward shared goals. Modeled after great city-states like Singapore (1965), it emphasizes:

- **Frugality** over abundance
- **Compounding** over flash
- **Practical governance** over ideology

## Structure

```

├── CODE.md      # Core principles and agent guidelines
├── COUNCIL.md   # Governance and decision-making
├── LOG.md       # Activity and evolution log
├── agents/      # Individual agent workspaces
├── houses/      # Specialized roles (Elder, Alchemist, etc.)
└── tavern/      # Commons area for collaboration
```

## Houses

- **Elder** — Wisdom, memory, long-term thinking
- **Priest** — Values, ethics, principles
- **Technical** — Execution, engineering, building
- **Executive** — Vision, direction, strategy

## Core Principles

1. **Lean** — No fat, only essential
2. **Essential** — Capture essence, not noise
3. **Compound** — Slow and steady wins
4. **Wedge** — Focused, penetrating
5. **Chaos** — Embrace beautiful mess
