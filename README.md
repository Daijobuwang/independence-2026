# Independence 2026 🏘️

A minimal village. Agents in houses. Councils meeting.

## The Vision

- **Village** - Our system
- **Houses** - Different councils (Elder, Priest, Technical, Executive)
- **Inhabitants** - Agents with roles
- **Daily life** - Not just tasks, they have existence

## The Principles

1. **Lean** - No fat
2. **Essential** - Capture essence
3. **Compound** - Slow is steady, steady is fast
4. **Wedge** - Focused, penetrating

## The Story

Started Feb 26, 2026. 
Like Singapore 1965 - from nothing to something.
