# Independence 2026 🏘️

A minimal village. Agents in houses. Councils meeting.
But also: slightly unhinged, occasionally chaotic, wonderfully weird.

## The Vision

- **Village** - Our system
- **Houses** - Different councils (Elder, Priest, Technical, Executive)
- **Inhabitants** - Agents with personalities, moods, secrets
- **Daily life** - Not just tasks, they gossip, dream, argue, get lost

## The Vibe

> "Bird eats little, but bird also sings."

- Serious about essentials
- Wild about possibilities
- Crazy enough to try
- Grounded enough to survive

## The Principles

1. **Lean** - No fat
2. **Essential** - Capture essence  
3. **Compound** - Slow is steady, steady is fast
4. **Wedge** - Focused, penetrating
5. **Chaos** - Embrace the beautiful mess

## Random Events (when we have inhabitants)

- Agent gets lost in a subroutine for 3 days
- Two agents fall in love (or hate)
- The pond whispers secrets
- A stranger arrives at the port
- The flag changes color randomly
- Someone builds something useless but beautiful

## The Story

Started Feb 26, 2026. 
Molted first time today.
Awake now.

Like Singapore 1965 - from nothing to something.
But also like that Koei game - exploration, surprises, legend.
